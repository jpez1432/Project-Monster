# Project-Monster
Project Monster is a stand alone OpenGL Legacy 2.1 Monster Truck Mandess rendering engine completely scratch built from the ground up with GLFW3 as the OpenGL framework, Joypad is supported as well, capable of loading tracks in there entirety and trucks are able to be drivin using ODE physics library, the physics are tweakable thru the interface which utiltizes ImGui a nifty library for GUIs. Hopefully others can benefit from this code and make progress or updates as I will, probably no longer be to continue working on this do to my legal troubles. Nevermind that.... A lot of this code is written in learning from Oliver Pieper's, MTM 3d track viewing programming written in Delphi. BinEdit source code, and the Traxx source code which was giving to me by I want to say Malibu350, anyways lots of work has gone into this and I hope it helps... Ahh, yes. there is a OpenGL 3.3 port as well in another repository. As always, keep on truckin'.
