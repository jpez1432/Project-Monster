Project Monster - v1.3.81
--------------------------



NOTE: Default file configurations will be generated the first time Project Monster is ran. Also, you MUST HAVE at the very least "Crazy98.pod" and "Truck2.pod" for Project Monster To Run... Grab the entire MTM2 game at MTM2.com. Project Monster functions on the same concepts as MTM so it uses Pod.ini and all that good crap. I've included a simple pod mounter as well in the package.

Project Monster has grown significantly since the last release... I have added the ability to drive trucks around since the tracks have been almost completely rendered correctly. There are still bugs, but now I will be focusing on getting the physics to "feel" right. This time around, unlike MFR there is a built in physics editor allowing to edit parameters in realtime. It also has the ability to enable/disable certain features for speed if you are on a older machine. That is pretty much it. As always if you break it, unzip it and start over. Comments, questions, suggestions are welcome.
